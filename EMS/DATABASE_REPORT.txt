DATABASE SETUP PROCESS

Follow these steps to establish the Employee Management System database:

Step 1: PostgreSQL Installation

1. Download PostgreSQL from the official website (https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
2. Run the installer and follow installation wizard
3. Set a strong master password for the postgres superuser
4. Note the port number (default: 5432) and installation directory
5. Ensure PostgreSQL service is running in system services

Step 2: Database Creation and Configuration

1. Launch pgAdmin 4 from your applications menu
2. Connect to the PostgreSQL server using your master password
3. Right-click "Databases" → "Create" → "Database"
4. Name the database: employee_management_system
5. Set Owner to postgres and Encoding to UTF8
6. Click "Save" to create the database

Step 3: Schema Implementation

1. Open the Query Tool in pgAdmin for your new database
2. Load the provided SQL schema file (Database_SQL_Schema.sql)
3. Execute the complete schema to create all tables, indexes, and constraints
4. Verify successful creation by checking the "Tables" section in the browser panel

The schema includes:
- 12 main tables with comprehensive relationships
- Custom ENUM types for data standardization:
  - user_role: HR_ADMIN, MANAGER, EMPLOYEE
  - gender_type: MALE, FEMALE, OTHER
  - employment_status_type: ACTIVE, INACTIVE, TERMINATED, ON_LEAVE
  - attendance_status_type: PRESENT, ABSENT, LATE, HALF_DAY, WORK_FROM_HOME
  - timeoff_type: VACATION, SICK_LEAVE, PERSONAL, MATERNITY, PATERNITY, BEREAVEMENT, OTHER
  - request_status_type: PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED, CANCELLED
- Automatic triggers for timestamp management
- Strategic indexes for optimized query performance
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity

Step 4: Database User Management

Create specific database users for different application roles:

-- Create application-specific database users
CREATE ROLE ems_app_user WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'secure_ems_password';
CREATE ROLE ems_readonly WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'readonly_password';

-- Grant appropriate permissions
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO ems_app_user, ems_readonly;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO ems_app_user;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO ems_app_user;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO ems_readonly;

-- Grant permissions on future tables
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO ems_app_user;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO ems_readonly;

Step 5: Sample Data Population

Insert initial data for testing and demonstration:

-- Insert sample departments
INSERT INTO departments (department_name, department_code, description, budget, location) 
VALUES 
('Human Resources', 'HR', 'Employee management and policies', 500000.00, 'Lagos Office'),
('Information Technology', 'IT', 'Software development and infrastructure', 750000.00, 'Tech Hub'),
('Finance', 'FIN', 'Financial planning and analysis', 400000.00, 'Main Building'),
('Marketing', 'MKT', 'Marketing and customer engagement', 300000.00, 'Marketing Floor'),
('Operations', 'OPS', 'Business operations and logistics', 600000.00, 'Operations Center');

-- Insert sample positions
INSERT INTO positions (position_title, position_code, department_id, job_description, min_salary, max_salary)
VALUES 
('HR Manager', 'HR-MGR', 1, 'Oversee HR operations and staff management', 150000.00, 200000.00),

-- Insert sample employees
INSERT INTO employees (employee_number, first_name, last_name, personal_email, phone, department_id, position_id, salary, hire_date, employment_status)
VALUES 
('EMP001', 'Adebayo', 'Olamide', 'adebayo.olamide@company.com', '+2348012345678', 1, 1, 175000.00, '2023-01-15', 'ACTIVE'),
('EMP002', 'Fatima', 'Ibrahim', 'fatima.ibrahim@company.com', '+2348023456789', 2, 2, 150000.00, '2023-03-20', 'ACTIVE'),

Step 6: Database Security Configuration

Implement security measures for production readiness:

1. Enable SSL connections for encrypted data transmission
2. Configure pg_hba.conf for IP-based access control
3. Set up regular automated backups using pg_dump
4. Enable audit logging for compliance requirements
5. Implement connection pooling for optimal performance

Example security configurations:
ALTER SYSTEM SET ssl = on;
ALTER SYSTEM SET log_statement = 'all';
ALTER SYSTEM SET log_destination = 'csvlog';
SELECT pg_reload_conf();

Step 7: Performance Optimization

Configure PostgreSQL for optimal performance:

-- Analyze tables for query optimization
ANALYZE employees;
ANALYZE departments;
ANALYZE attendance_records;
ANALYZE time_off_requests;
ANALYZE performance_reviews;

-- Create additional performance indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_employees_search ON employees USING gin(to_tsvector('english', first_name || ' ' || last_name));
CREATE INDEX idx_attendance_monthly ON attendance_records(employee_id, date_trunc('month', attendance_date));
CREATE INDEX idx_attendance_status_date ON attendance_records(status, attendance_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_salary_history_effective ON salary_history(employee_id, effective_date DESC);

Advanced SQL Features Implemented:

The system showcases several advanced PostgreSQL features:

1. Recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Employee hierarchy query:
WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (
    SELECT employee_id, first_name || ' ' || last_name AS employee_name, 
           manager_id, 0 as level, ARRAY[employee_id] as path
    FROM employees 
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL AND employment_status = 'ACTIVE'
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name || ' ' || e.last_name AS employee_name,
           e.manager_id, eh.level + 1, eh.path || e.employee_id
    FROM employees e
    JOIN employee_hierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.employee_id
    WHERE e.employment_status = 'ACTIVE'
)
SELECT * FROM employee_hierarchy ORDER BY path;

2. Complex JOINs and Aggregations

Department performance analytics:
SELECT 
    d.department_name,
    COUNT(e.employee_id) as total_employees,
    AVG(e.salary) as average_salary,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN e.hire_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year' THEN 1 END) as new_hires_1_year,
    ROUND((COUNT(e.employee_id) * AVG(e.salary)) / NULLIF(d.budget, 0) * 100, 2) as salary_budget_ratio
FROM departments d
LEFT JOIN employees e ON d.department_id = e.department_id AND e.employment_status = 'ACTIVE'
GROUP BY d.department_id, d.department_name, d.budget
ORDER BY total_employees DESC;

3. Window Functions for Analytics

Attendance patterns analysis:
SELECT 
    e.employee_id,
    e.first_name || ' ' || e.last_name AS employee_name,
    COUNT(ar.attendance_id) as total_days,
    ROUND(
        COUNT(CASE WHEN ar.status = 'PRESENT' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / 
        NULLIF(COUNT(ar.attendance_id), 0), 2
    ) as attendance_percentage,
    AVG(ar.total_hours) as average_daily_hours
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN attendance_records ar ON e.employee_id = ar.employee_id
WHERE e.employment_status = 'ACTIVE'
GROUP BY e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name;

4. Generated Columns for Automatic Calculations

Automatic total hours calculation in attendance_records:
total_hours DECIMAL(4,2) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
    CASE 
        WHEN check_in_time IS NOT NULL AND check_out_time IS NOT NULL 
        THEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (check_out_time - check_in_time)) / 3600
        ELSE 0
    END
) STORED
