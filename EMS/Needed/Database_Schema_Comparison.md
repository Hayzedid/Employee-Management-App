# Database Schema Comparison Analysis

## Executive Summary
After cross-checking your actual PostgreSQL database schema against the DBML ER diagram, there are **significant differences**. The actual database is more comprehensive and has additional tables that are not reflected in the DBML diagram.

## 🔍 Detailed Comparison

### ✅ Tables Present in Both (Core Tables)
| Table | DBML | Actual DB | Status |
|-------|------|-----------|---------|
| users | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ Match |
| employees | ✓ | ✓ | ⚠️ Differences |
| departments | ✓ | ✓ | ⚠️ Differences |
| positions | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ Match |
| attendance_records | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ Match |
| time_off_requests | ✓ | ✓ | ⚠️ Differences |
| performance_reviews | ✓ | ✓ | ⚠️ Differences |
| salary_history | ✓ | ✓ | ⚠️ Differences |

### ❌ Tables Missing from DBML (Present Only in Actual DB)
| Table | Purpose | Impact |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **benefits** | Employee benefits catalog | High - Major business feature |
| **employee_benefits** | Junction table for employee-benefit relationships | High - Required for benefits |
| **training_records** | Employee training and certification tracking | Medium - Professional development |

### ❌ Tables Missing from Actual DB (Present Only in DBML)
| Table | Purpose | Impact |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **emergency_contacts** | Emergency contact information | Medium - Safety feature |
| **documents** | Document management system | Medium - File management |
| **notifications** | User notification system | Low - UI enhancement |
| **audit_logs** | System audit trail | High - Security/compliance |

## 🔧 Field-Level Differences

### employees Table
**Actual DB has additional fields:**
- `date_of_birth` (DATE)
- `gender` (gender_type ENUM)
- `personal_email` (VARCHAR)
- `phone` (VARCHAR)
- `address` (TEXT)
- `termination_date` (DATE)
- `emergency_contact_name` (VARCHAR)
- `emergency_contact_phone` (VARCHAR)

**DBML missing these personal information fields**

### departments Table
**Actual DB differences:**
- `description` (TEXT) - missing in DBML
- `parent_department_id` instead of `parent_dept_id`

### time_off_requests Table
**Actual DB differences:**
- Missing `requested_by` field
- Has `approved_date` instead of `approval_date`
- Missing `rejection_reason` field
- Has `comments` instead

### performance_reviews Table
**Actual DB differences:**
- `goals_achievement` (TEXT) instead of separate `goals_achieved`/`goals_total` integers
- Additional fields: `manager_comments`, `employee_comments`
- Missing `status` field

### salary_history Table
**Actual DB differences:**
- `salary_history_id` as PK instead of `salary_id`
- `previous_salary` and `new_salary` instead of just `salary_amount`
- `change_type` (salary_change_type ENUM) instead of `salary_type`
- `change_reason` instead of `reason`
- Missing `end_date` field

## 🎯 Additional ENUMs in Actual DB
The actual database has more comprehensive ENUM types:
- `gender_type`
- `benefit_type`
- `training_status_type`
- `salary_change_type`

## 📊 Missing Indexes and Constraints
Your actual database includes:
- Comprehensive indexing strategy
- Generated columns (e.g., `total_hours` in attendance_records)
- Check constraints for data validation
- Trigger functions for automatic timestamp updates

## 🚨 Critical Issues Found

### 1. **DBML is Incomplete** (High Priority)
The DBML diagram doesn't represent your full database schema. It's missing:
- 3 entire tables (benefits, employee_benefits, training_records)
- Key personal information fields in employees
- Important audit and document management features

### 2. **Field Naming Inconsistencies** (Medium Priority)
- `parent_department_id` vs `parent_dept_id`
- `salary_history_id` vs `salary_id`
- `approved_date` vs `approval_date`

### 3. **Business Logic Gaps** (Medium Priority)
- DBML lacks the benefits management system
- Missing training/professional development tracking
- No audit trail for compliance

## 💡 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Update DBML File** - Update the ER_Diagram.dbml to match your actual schema
2. **Add Missing Tables** - Include benefits, employee_benefits, training_records
3. **Add Missing Fields** - Include all personal information fields in employees
4. **Fix Field Names** - Standardize naming conventions

### For Academic Report:
- Use the **actual database schema** as the authoritative source
- Update your documentation to reflect the complete system
- Highlight the comprehensive nature of your implementation

## 🎯 Conclusion

Your **actual database is more sophisticated** than represented in the DBML diagram. The real schema includes:
- Employee benefits management
- Training and development tracking
- More comprehensive employee profiles
- Better data validation and constraints
- Performance optimization features

**Action Required:** The DBML file needs to be updated to accurately represent your actual database implementation for your academic report.
